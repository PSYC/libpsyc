libpsyc implements various functions required to use psyc. 

See http://about.psyc.eu/libpsyc for more information on the library.
See http://about.psyc.eu/Specification for more information
    on the new PSYC specification.
See http://about.psyc.eu for information on PSYC in general.

The plain C API located in the include/psyc directory along with the file psyc.h
is primarily intended to be used for binding with other languages and frameworks.

Available bindings are located in include/<name> where name is the lanugage or
framework.


== Directory Overview ==

doc     -- where the documentation will be put after generation
include -- contains all bindings and the core C API for the library
lib     -- where the compiled library will be put
src     -- contains the sourcecode of the library
test    -- contains test sourcecodes and test input files

== Compiling libpsyc ==

Type 

  make

and you are done.
Other possible targets include:

  make diet   -- compile with diet libc
  make test   -- compile and run the test
  make doc    -- generate the API documentation (will be put in the doc folder)
  make help   -- display the possible targets

== Requirements ==

libpsyc is currently known to compile under Linux and SunOS.
