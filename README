libpsyc implements various functions required to use PSYC. 

See http://about.psyc.eu/libpsyc for more information on the library.
See http://about.psyc.eu/Specification for more information
    on the new PSYC specification.
See http://about.psyc.eu for information on PSYC in general.

The plain C API located in the include/psyc directory along with the file psyc.h
is primarily intended to be used for binding with other languages and frameworks.

The LPC binding for psyced is distributed with psyclpc since it is spread
over several files (LPC has no simple approach to binding). Other bindings
are located directly in the root folder named according to the language or
framework. Currently there's only a binding for D.

== C API ==

The "plain C API" is a very low-level API intended to be used for bindings.
To access a certain module of the library, just include the according header
file from the psyc directory:

psyc.h        -- basic things for well-being
psyc/parse.h  -- parse psyc packets
psyc/render.h -- render psyc packets
psyc/text.h   -- text template functions 
psyc/packet.h -- structures for render.h and functions to initialize them
psyc/syntax.h -- definitions and constants related to parsing and rendering

== Directory Overview ==

doc     -- target folder for the documentation after generation (make doc)
include -- the core C API for the library
lib     -- target folder for the compiled library (make) 
src     -- the sourcecode of the library
test    -- test sourcecodes and test input files
d       -- the D binding 

== Compiling libpsyc ==

Type 

  make

and you are done.
Other possible targets include:

  make diet   -- compile with diet libc
  make test   -- compile and run the test
  make doc    -- generate the API documentation (will be put in the doc folder)
  make help   -- display the possible targets

== Requirements ==

libpsyc is currently known to compile under Linux and SunOS.

== Contributors And Contribution ==

The library is being developed by 

* tg     -- psyc://psyced.org/~tg 
* lynx   -- psyc://psyced.org/~lynx
* Marenz -- psyc://supraverse.net/~marenz

If you created new bindings, patches or anything other that you think should go
into the library, contact either anyone of us directly or just join the
developement room at

== Licence ==

-- To be discussed --

== Style Wars ==

This source code should follow the http://about.psyc.eu/Indent conventions.
    (if you have good reasons to use another style, discuss it on the
     wiki page so that it becomes the general style convention for all
     of us, not just for you).
